# PMD Ontologies

This repository contains the ontologies for http://publishmydata.com.

The `src` in this repository is used as a dependency of other projects, e.g. https://github.com/Swirrl/Muttnik.

You can browse the ontologies by dereferencing the URIs in your browser. e.g. http://publishmydata.com/def/pmdkos will redirect to a page served at http://ontologies.publishmydata.com/ontologies/pmdkos (served by Netlify).

At the moment, rewrites for publishmydata.com URIs are handled by the Netlify config that serves swirrl.com (see https://github.com/Swirrl/swirrldotcom)
